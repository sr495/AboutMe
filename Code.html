    <p>
        My career goal is to get into the field of computer science. 
        My plans for achieving this goal is to take computer science courses every year.
        I want to also take the AP Comp Science course in either my Junior or Senior year.
        I want to get into the field of computer science because it's been a childhood interest.
        I've also always been interested in making new apps.
        In 7th grade, I made a version of tetris with new versions of blocks, and also other modes besides the regular one.
        In Middle School, I always took PLTW related electives; Computer Science for Innovators and Makers, App Creators, Design and Modeling, and Automation and Robotics.

        <p>
        I have always exceeded the standard for math on every CAASPP test I've taken.
        I know how to make decently advanced programs in HTML, Javascript and Python.
        I'm also currently running cross country in the Junior Varsity team.
        I'm a very friendly person and am very easy to approach and work with.
        I also can help people understand their errors and help them understand how to fix their errors, or if they can't understand, I can help them understand what to do.
